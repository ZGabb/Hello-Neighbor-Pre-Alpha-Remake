# Hello-Neighbor-Pre-Alpha-Remake
This is basically a fangame of Hello Neighbor Pre Alpha but even better. Just like in the AI Rundown video, it will be something like that.
It will have the same mechanics and AI. This project won't have c++ but instead we'll be using blueprints for the objects and characters.
Teasers of this remake will be posted here. We will update you guys if there are any updates to this or if there are any bugs :)
